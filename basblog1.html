		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;For my last passion blog I thought it would be a good idea to write about one of the best basketball players that has ever existed. Kobe Bean Bryant, also known as the Black Mamba, has been one of the top players in the NBA as long as I can remember. He has been one of the most dominant forces in the league since he first got into the league and sadly his career is close to ending. Kobe Bryant was born on August 23rd, 1978 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Kobe entered the NBA right out of high school and has been on the Los Angeles Lakers for his entire career, winning them 5 National Championships.

			&emsp; &emsp; On top of those Championships, here are a few more of Kobe’s outstanding achievements. He is a 15-time All-Star, 14-time member of the All-NBA Team, and 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team. On top of all of that, Kobe ranks third in the league for all-time postseason scoring and fourth in all-time regular season scoring lists. Kobe also won the prestigious Slam Dunk Contest his rookie year, which is one of the most impressive things about him in my opinion. These statistics are ridiculous for any basketball player and are surely going to put him in the hall of fame. Kobe made history at the age of 34 years old, when he became the youngest player in the NBA to ever reach 30,000 points! Now Kobe is an amazing basketball player and all, but hes much more than that. I’ve been following him since I started watching basketball when I first moved to this country. He is one of the oldest superstars that is still in the league, but he doesn’t let his age get to him. He is almost 10 years older than all of the best players in the league but he still competes for that position. He is a leader, someone you need on your team to make the last shot when it really counts. He is an inspiration and a role model for a lot of people and it will be a sad day when he retires but another happy one when he gets inducted into the Hall of Fame.
