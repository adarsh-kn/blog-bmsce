		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;Indian Institute Of Chemical Engineers is a confluence of streams of professionals from academia,  research  institute  and  industry.  It  provides  them  the  appropriate  forum  for  jointendeavors,   hand-in-hand,   to   work   for   human   being   through   application   of   chemical engineering and allied sciences. The  Indian  Institute  of  Chemical  Engineers  is  the  governing  body  for  all  the activities and  events  related  to  chemical  engineering  conducted  by  colleges  under  the  Bangalore Regional Centre (BRC). Bangalore Regional Centre (BRC), established in mid twentieth century and nurtured by the Chemical Engineering Department of Indian Institute of Science, is one of the oldest regional centers of Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers. The experts from leading research and technical education institutes as well as several industries contribute to the wide variety  of  activities  of  the  center.  The  chemical  engineering  professionals  have  tremendously benefitted  from  various  courses  in  cutting  edge  areas  of  the  time,  such  as  computer-aided design and biotechnology.
		</p>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp;There are eight colleges under Bangalore Regional Centre, out of which BMS College of Engineering is one. BMSCE IIChE Student chapter is one of the most active clubs in the college which  conducts  events at  grand  levels.  The  student  chapter  activities  are  guided  solely  by  our beloved  HOD,  Dr.  G  N  Rameshaiah  and  the  faculty  coordinator  Mr.  Soumen  Panda.  The  club activities are initiated and planned by the core committee. As Mahatma Gandhi rightly said, “The best way to find  you  is  to  lose  yourself  in  the service  of  others”. The  core  committee  comprises  of  the  Student  President  Tarun  Malhotra, Student Vice President Pratiksha Doddamani, Secretary Akash Gupta and Treasurer Muttu A. The  volunteers  are  a  significant  part  of  the  events  conducted  by  IIChE.  No  work is possible  without  the  volunteers.  The  volunteers  are  Pavan  Kumar  S  D,  Ashwini  Anand,  Aman Bhuwania  and  Yash  Anand.  Even  though  we  hold  different  positions  in  the  BMSCE  IIChE Student Chapter, all of us believe that no work is small. Everybody, from top to bottom indulge in the work equally. Everyone is full of vigour and enthusiasm to work for the student chapter activities. As it is rightly said, “Coming together is a beginning, Keeping together is progress and Working together is success”. So, I believe we have achieved success by working together from  the  beginning  itself.  We  were  able  to  conduct  several  activities  at  a  grand  level  whichyielded magnanimous victory. The work environment created, when all of us work together is homely and it is for sure a cherishable treasure of memories.</p>
		 <p>&emsp; &emsp;Among the many events that we conducted, one was the IIChE Children’s Day event, in which we organized two seminars by distinguished guests and professors from Indian Institute of Science  (IISc).  The  seminars  were  a  heavy  dose  of  knowledge  for  all  of  us.  They  motivated  the students and filled them with determination to pursue their passion.  We  also  conducted  a  debate  and  a  quiz  competition.  The  responses  for  those  were tremendously huge. Even students from different colleges showed up. The debate competition was an   interesting   one   as   all   the   speakers   had   the   domain   knowledge   as   well   as   excellent communication skills. In Quiz competition, the moderators blasted the participants with questions similar   to   a   rapid   fire.   The   alacrity   with   which   all   the   answers   were   bouncing   back   was commendable. We  also  conducted  the  “Prof.  Kuloor  Memorial  Essay  Competition”  in  which  several competitors had participated. The essay writing competition was cut throat. It was elating to see how much competition spirit was there among the students.  We also conducted the “IIChE Best Project Award” event in which there was a show up from six  colleges.  Everyone  had  brilliant  ideas  as  to  how  to  combat  real  life  problems.  As  chemicalengineers, we not only think but also perform  and set examples on solving the major engineering problems.

		 <p>&emsp; &emsp; The  competition  was  fun  and provided  a  very  good learning experience.  The  beauty of the  competition  was  that,  all  the  teams  had  different  ideas  in  different  fields.  All the  events  and competitions conducted were a fair trial. Being  the  Student  President,  I  looked  after  and  managed  all  the  activities  and  events.  It was fun and I got to learn a lot of management practices. Being the President was never easy; the burden never light and the responsibilities never limited. It was a demanding job but with the help of  our  beloved  HOD  Dr.  GNR,  Faculty  coordinator  Mr.  Soumen  Panda,  core  committee  members and  volunteers  boosting  my  motivation  regularly,  I  was  able  to  handle  the  post  efficiently.  So  I thank  all  the  people,  the  faculty  members  and  the  students  who  have  helped  me  directly  or indirectly, in achieving success for the different ventures that we have tried.
