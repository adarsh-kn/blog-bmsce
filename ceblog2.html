		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;I  was  planning  for  a  fun  filled  summer  vacation  when  I  found  about  a  summer school organized by SRISTI at Ahmedabad. The criterion for selection was through designing a prototype for some mechanical devices that would ease the work of the underprivileged class of the society. I submitted mine for a ‘Cactus fruit plucker’.On being selected to the program I sought permission from my HOD, Dr. Samita Maitra who extended her kind cooperation by consenting immediately. I reached  Ahmedabad  wherein  I  was  excited  to  stay  at  IIM  Ahmedabad,  a  place  where great stalwarts had made their names!! Initially I was a bit nervous as I had to vie with the students all over India, most of them from the prestigious IITs. I garnered strength from the fact that I too was backed by one of the most prestigious colleges from Karnataka, BMSCE.

		<p>&emsp; &emsp;SRISTI is a non-profit organisation founded by Padmashree Dr.Anil K Gupta. The program was  oriented  towards  inclusive  innovation  and  providing  affordable  devices  to  the  poor  who  are facing hardships both economically and physically in their occupation. We were given projects like Mahua nut cracker, seed dribbler, cactus fruit plucker, broom maker and the load carrying device.</p>
		 <p>&emsp; &emsp;I  got  the  broom  making  device  as  my  project.  Basically,  we  had  to  be  innovative  in developing  the  machine  as  per  the  set  norms.  For  this,  we  went  on  field  trips where  we  had  to interact  with  people  engaged  in  the  specific  occupation.  Video  lectures from  professors  of  MIT, USA,  UC  Berkley  and  other  guides  from  Australia  and  India  were  arranged  for  suggestions  and guidance  on  how  to  go  about  with  the  project.  It  was  a  very  enjoyable though  hectic  schedule  of attending lectures, field trips, fabrications at workshops, report making and presentations. 
		 </p>
		 <p>&emsp; &emsp; In  around  20  days  under  the  supervision  of  Professor  Anil  Gupta  we  developed  a  hand driven  machine  for  making  brooms  from  a  bunch  of  palm  leaves.  In  the  making  of  brooms traditionally,  while  hitting  them  on  the  bed  of  nails  accidental  slippage  would result  in  hand hitting the nails. Our machine avoided such injuries. Finally  we  displayed  the  prototype  and  a  presentation  was  made at  a  press  conference. Our  device  was  widely  appreciated  by  the  team  of  experts.  Working  on  my  maiden  project,  the practical  knowledge  I  gained  through  interaction  with  several  budding  intellects  guided  by  the ace  bigwigs  broadened  my  horizon.  I  would  like  to  express  my  deepest  gratitude  towards  my department and college for this pleasurable experience.
