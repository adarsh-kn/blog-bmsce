		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;The  Confederation  of  Indian  Industry – Young  Indians  CII-Yi  in  collaboration  with  NSS Unit  of  BMSCE  organized  a  campaign  against  harmful  honking  effects  under  the  title HONK NOT  OKAY  PLEASE  (HNOP)  aiming at  making the  city  a  honk  free  city by  2020.  The  objective was to significantly reduce unnecessary vehicular honking in Bengaluru and make the citizensaware  of  the  hazardous  health  issues  related  to  it.  The  campaign  was  conducted  along  with Radio Indigo 91.9 FM in Indiranagar on 8th October 2016 at 8a.m.

		<p>&emsp; &emsp;The   campaign   was   supported   by   Bengaluru   Traffic   Police   (BTP),   State   Road Transportation   Department,   Pollution   Control   Board   and   other   organizations   working towards  making  Namma  Bengaluru  a  better  place  to  live.  10  students  from  The NSS  Unit, BMSCE  with  the  same  social  mindset  volunteered  for  the  social  cause.  The  event  was  an  eye opener and a huge success.</p>
		 <p>&emsp; &emsp;We  were  able  to  spread  awareness  amongst  public  against  unnecessary  honking.  Anattempt  to work  with the  government  authorities  to  enforce the  prevailing  rules  and  to  bring about new regulation based on the model of other “Honk free cities” in the world was the main objectives of the event. The event also enhanced skills in students in extracurricular activities.
