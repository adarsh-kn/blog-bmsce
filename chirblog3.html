		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;Time Travel is the series of blog in which we travel back in time to know the History, culture and significance of places. Today we will travel back in time to Bengaluru and know the interesting facts about the name that this city gets. If you ask the meaning of the name Bengaluru, first thing you will hear is Bendakaluru. What is this story behind Bendakaluru to Bengaluru? Is this a real Story?. Let me tell you three stories from which Bengaluru got its name and  will also reveal the real story at the end.

			&emsp; &emsp; Bendakaluru to Bengaluru --> Once Hoysala’s king Ballala went for hunting in the forest (currently known as Kodigehalli) He got separated from his troops and lost his path. While he almost strived to death because of thirst and hunger he found a hut nearby and asked for food and water. Looking at the king’s situation an old lady brought him boiled beans and water. He ate it and was very happy with the service. His sign of gratitude and reward to her was given away by coining the place with the name Bendakaluru (Boiled Beans city), which eventually became Bengaluru.<br>
			&emsp; &emsp; Bendakaduru to Bengaluru --> This is also a kind of folk story. When hiriya Kempegowda decided to build the city he cut down the trees, forest and burnt it to make a flat ground. As he burnt the forest people started to call this place as bendakaduru and it eventually became Bengaluru.<br>
			&emsp; &emsp; Venkaturu to Bengaluru --> This is the story which actually has a proof to tell it as a true story. Back in those days Kings from Vijayanagara Empire were devotees of lord Vishnu. So to please the kings, Kempegowda decided to build Venkata Ramana Swamy temples in few places. To support this story there is one Venkata Ramana temple near Avenue road and also Narasimha temple in Balepete. Because of many Vishnu temples, city is named as venkaturu. As the years passed venkaturu became Bengaluru.
