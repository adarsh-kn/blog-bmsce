		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;There is an increasing obsession to convince ourselves that everything we are seeing is the best it has ever been. It is a rampant obsession in almost every modern sport. There is a lot of discussion amongst the cricket fraternity currently about whether this bowler dominated era is making batting harder than it has ever been before. When I say era it would probably be more correct to say half decade, but following on from a superb piece on cricinfo a few weeks ago the debate needs to be expanded to look at how effective the batting against these bowling attacks is, too. The most common thing to do when looking at players past and present is to put too much emphasis on comparing stats directly against one another. Whilst having Test match averages such as Don Bradman’s 99.94 means we know who was probably the best batsman to grace the game, the ability to compare Mike Atherton’s career average of 37.69 against Rory Burns’s average to date of 33.90 is much trickier. The game has changed so dramatically even in the time I have been following it (the first Test match I went to was England vs India in 1990) so comparing eras with stats alone can be futile.

			&emsp; &emsp; However, it would be hard to argue with the suggestion that India’s pace attack, for instance, isn’t the best that they’ve ever had and, in truth, you don’t need to look at the numbers to determine that. Although they have produced talented pace bowlers such as Javagal Srinath and Zaheer Khan over the last 30 years, they have never had three or four of the quality of Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav that they have available now. It would also be tricky to debate whether any England pace attack consisting of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad could not be their best simply because they are the nation’s two leading wicket takers. Nevertheless, the famed 2005 pace attack of Andrew Flintoff, Steve Harmison, Matthew Hoggard and Simon Jones might possibly have been the most potent, but injury sadly meant we never saw that foursome in tandem again.
