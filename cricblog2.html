		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;You’ve probably already heard of COVID-19 and felt some of its impact. It has left nothing untouched, not even the sacrosanct English pursuit of the sound of leather on willow echoing across village greens up and down the country. Professional sport was halted almost everywhere and cricket was no exception.
		At one stage the prospect of getting back out and playing at all in 2020 looked bleak. The ECB, to the surprise of absolutely no one, was inexplicably slow at pushing for a resumption of the amateur game. Unless there is a multi-million-pound TV deal on the table, the ECB isn’t really interested in anything. As other sports such as golf, tennis, football and even basketball were given the greenlight to resume, cricket dithered. It’s odd that cricket is sport run by people who seem to absolutely detest cricket.

			&emsp; &emsp; A further setback for the sport was proffered by no lesser voice than British prime minister, Boris Johnson, who described the humble cricket ball as “a vector of the disease.” Dark forces were clearly at work behind the scenes; perhaps Dominic Cummings’s sister’s brother in law has one eye on a village green for a property deal and needs to shut down the pesky cricket club first? I can’t prove that, I should add, it’s just a musing. But would you be surprised? This shitshow rolled on for quite some time. Once people were ambiguously releases from lockdown to fraternise with other human beings with whom they did not share a dwelling, clandestine net sessions were being organised to hone the skills in the hope of summer being allowed to commence.
