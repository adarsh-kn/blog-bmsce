		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;Sourav Ganguly scored a huge amount of runs for his national team as he became a massive legend in cricket. However, it was at the 2003 World Cup that Ganguly created a record that will give him an endless lifetime of prestige. Sourav Ganguly has always been a star in Indian cricket. He has been credited with transforming people’s perspective towards cricket in India as he built a fearless attitude in young cricketers towards the sport. The brand of cricket played under the captaincy of Ganguly gave India a big boost as the Men in Blue reached the final of the 2003 World Cup while constantly beating matches and series’ in South Africa, England, and Australia.

			&emsp; &emsp; It wasn’t only his captaincy that gave Ganguly his name with the gods of the game but also his great batting style. Ganguly scored a plethora of runs for his country as he became a legend of the sport. On this day in 2003, Ganguly created a prestigious record. On March 20, 2003, Ganguly became the first Indian batsman to score a century in a knock-out match of the ICC World Cup. This gave the cricket betting industry a big boost in India, with their national team winning the world cup with a broken world record. He had made the amazing achievement in a match versus Kenya in Durban, during the 2003 World Cup semi-final at Kingsmead. In the match, India won the toss and elected to bat first. Openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag made 74 runs for the first wicket. However, Sehwag got out in the 19th over, and it was then that Ganguly came out to bat.

			&emsp; &emsp; Ganguly and Tendulkar managed to reach a total of 103 runs during the second wicket. The player known as the Master Blaster was dismissed for 83, yet the Prince of Kolkata went on to score 111 runs with the help of five sixes and five fours. India made a whopping 270/4 in the allotted fifty overs and then bowled out Kenya for 179 to make it up to the finals of the tournament. In the summit-clash, India beat Australia in Johannesburg. The only other Indian batsman to score a century in a World Cup knockout game is Rohit Sharma, who scored a huge amount of runs against Bangladesh in the quarter-final clash of the 2015 cricket World Cup in Australia.
