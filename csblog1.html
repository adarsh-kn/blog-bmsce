			<h1>My Experience as a Placement Coordinator</h1>

		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;The year 2020 is certainly going down in history. As a member of the graduating batch, despite all the hurdles, I’m sure I’ll never forget these four years of my bachelor’s degree education. From being a reclusive 1st-year student to a confident graduate ready to head out into the world, I’ve seen myself grow into a better version of myself. From being poked and prodded by my friends to stand for the class placement coordinator selection to being able to interact with corporate recruiters, I’ve come a long way. The exhilarating experiences of getting placed and coming home to the happy faces of my family, watching my batchmates getting placed, and congratulating them will always be my most cherished memories. Throw in some free food and meeting new people every day and voila, a nourishing experience right there! Safe to say, getting placed in BMS and working as a coordinator has been a nostalgic experience.
