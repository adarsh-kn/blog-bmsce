		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;Hi! I'm Deepthi T from the CSE department of our college. I am here to tell you about my first interview. Guess the company?? You are right if you guessed it as Google!! Yeah, so I was selected for the 4th stage of the interview process which was of one-to-one interaction type. As your job interview comes to an end, make sure you find out when you'll be informed of the outcome - and thank the interviewer for giving you the chance to attend. Make some notes about the questions that were asked and how you answered them while the interview is still fresh in your memory

			&emsp; &emsp; While many employers still expect candidates to dress smartly, a growing number encourage casual wear at work, making it trickier than ever to choose an interview outfit. What you'll be expected to wear depends on factors such as the size of the company, the industry it operates in and the culture it promotes. For example, a small creative agency may have different standards to a major accountancy firm. If you're unsure on the dress code, ask before attending the interview. The key point to remember is that it's much better to be too smart than too casual. Only opt for a more casual outfit if you're absolutely certain that's acceptable - if there's any doubt, always go for smart business attire. Whatever you choose, make sure that your clothes are ironed and your shoes are clean.
