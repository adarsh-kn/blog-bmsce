		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;In the simplest terms python is an interpreted computer language, but what	makes it so great and convenient to	program with is the fact that it is very simple, has very little boilerplate code and the programs written with it seems intuitive. I first learnt python when I was in second year of college. In the beginning it was just
			another programming language like C++ or Java. Sometimes its reach isn't immediately obvious. I started off using it
			just to learn a new language. Initially I used Python just to write some small programs for which writing Java or C
			programs seemed an overkill (with all the import statements and class declarations and function signatures and stuff). With Python all this boilerplate code was gone, a print program was truly only a print statement.

			&emsp; &emsp; Python definitely is for everyone (maybe not for literally everyone; why would a plumber need Python?; Well i'd say it's applications are limited only by our imagination). Lets see how Python is useful to students right from school. Irrespective of the domain a student is interested in, one thing that is unchanging is automation. Automation is relevant in every possible field, be it art or engineering. And Python is definitely a huge enabler for automation. Python becomes an easy to use tool that students can use to bring their imagination and creativity to life. Coming to undergrad students and engineering professionals, automation is literally the central idea to their profession. Thus, Python can be seen as a gateway to effectively utilising the immense power of computation the modern world has to offer in every field of life.
