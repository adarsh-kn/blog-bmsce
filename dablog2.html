		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;I enjoy how varied dance can be and the freedom of expression it gives. I love ballet in particular because of its beauty and complexity.Dancing makes me feel calm after a busy day, as well as energised. It clears my mind and gives me a natural energy boost. I love the fact that whatever has happened during my day or week I can leave it behind as soon as I put my ballet shoes on. Dancing over the years has also definitely increased my confidence.

			&emsp; &emsp; Dancing is a step to a healthy lifestyle. It has health benefits from increasing stamina, relieving stress, and body sculpting to name a few. But it's also great for mental and emotional health. I feel that dance brings people together and provides them with a sense of community with people that have the same interests and passion. I feel very fortunate having the students that I do in Bollywood dance: they inspire me and are the reason why I continue to teach. I enjoy seeing people gain confidence in things that they thought they could never do, like perform for an audience. Dance allows people to exceed their own expectations and helps them to discover new things about themselves. Dancing in my free time helps me to feel good about myself and pushes me to keep progressing and improving. The social side of meeting and and learning with new people is part of the fun, alongside the obvious physical health benefits.
