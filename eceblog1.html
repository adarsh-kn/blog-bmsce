		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;Placement season starts in July end in BMSCE. Most of the companies offer job profile related to computer science like IT software engineer, Java developer, Solutions architect, software developer,data scientist etc . ECE students are also allowed to sit for most of the companies that come for CSE and ISE. ECE students should study computer science subjects like DBMS,OS and practice data structures and algorithms and should be able to code in atleast one language. Only then, there will be a chance to get placed in a company with 10+ package whose job profile is IT related.

		<p>
			&emsp; &emsp;There are also companies that offer electronics profile, but the number is very low. There are also companies which do mass recruitment and students of all branches are allowed to sit for those companies. But the package is comparatively low.I would suggest to choose a job profile which you are really interested apart from package.
