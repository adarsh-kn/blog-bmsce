		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;The age of digital electronics has come to be one of the most significant developments in the history of society. What were once manual time-consuming tasks and processes have now become programmed to the point where multi-tasking is an expected part of our lifestyles. So what is considered to be a digital electronic? They are sophisticated devices capable of sending information through electronic signals from point A to point B. The information is transmitted from one circuit to another by using electronic currents. However, the logic sequences that have been incorporated into the electrical circuit is what distinguishes digital electronics from the electronic devices from the past. Binary logic, also known as Boolean theory, implements a base two-value logic system of “true” and “false” to transport information through electric signals.

			&emsp; &emsp; The electronic gate (circuit) is the source of what makes the electronics work. The electronic gate is where and how an electric current is sent. The first gate was a relay device invented by Joseph Henry in 1835, the next was a vacuum tube invented in 1904 by Sir John Ambrose. Soon after, transistors were developed leading to the construction of integrated circuits and microprocessors, which the digital electronics of today are made out of.
