		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;A floating nuclear power plant is a site with one or more nuclear reactors, located on a platform at sea.It is an autonomous site that can provide electricity and heat to areas with difficult access, such as the cold Northern territories. It can also provide drinking water to dry areas, via desalination techniques.

		<p>
			&emsp; &emsp;The worldâ€™s first floating nuclear power plant is currently being built at the Baltiysky Zavod shipyard in Saint Petersburg, Russia. This site, known as Akademik Lomonosov, is the property of the Russian nuclear operator Rosenergoatom. It contains two KLT-40C naval propulsion reactors with a 35 MWe capacity each. These are mounted on a barge that is 144 meters long by 30 meters wide. The plant does not self propel, but must be towed to its destination and dock at the required port. Operation is previewed for 2017 at the Chukotka district, in Northwestern Russia.

			&emsp; &emsp;Experts consider that this type of plant offers many advantages. To start with, it can be built at a factory or shipyard, eliminating the need to set up a special site for its construction. Location is also simplified, since it is not necessary to carry out viability studies on the land and land environment. Additionally, it has a very low environmental impact and the dismantling can be done in a specialized site. The sea environment, however, makes it necessary to take a few factors into account, such as access for the staff and the equipment, as well as the need to make sure that the radioactive material is never leaked to the sea.
