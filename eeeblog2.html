		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;The future of computing is microscopic. For decades, technology has followed the same pattern: as speed and capability increase, cost and size shrink. It can be seen in the transformation from the mainframes of the 1960s that filled entire rooms to the bulky PCs that became ubiquitous in the 1990s to the paper-thin laptops, tablets and smartphones we use today.

		<p>
			&emsp; &emsp;Based on that [trend], we should be arriving very soon at millimetre-scale computing systems,” said David Blaauw, a professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at the University of Michigan, who has spent decades working to miniaturise computing systems.

			&emsp; &emsp;In 1997, the researcher Kristofer Pister coined the term ‘smart dust’ to describe these millimetre-sized devices. Pister and his colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley, aimed to create a network of sensors made up of tiny wireless computer systems called ‘motes’. Acting as microscopic eyes, ears and arms, these motes could rove around the world collecting all kinds of data: visual, thermal, chemical and biological. In theory, smart dust could revolutionise industries by reaching places scientists never thought possible
