		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;The  hands  on  session  wereconducted  by Mr. Prashanth  Rao,  President,  Saddiksha  Public Charitable TrustThe   session   was   started   off   by   Mr.   Prashanth   Rao,   with   a   brief   description   on   the importance  of  commitment  and  contribution  in  one's  life.  Mind  is  like  a  monkey  ,the thoughts  always  wander  between  the past and  the  further  .  So  the  students  were  told  this mantra to bring their mind back to the present : " I am not listening , that I am not listening, that I am not listening".

		<p>&emsp; &emsp; The  thing  that  distresses  most  of  the  young  minds  is  fear.  Fear  is  the  threshold  that  one needs  to  cross  over  to  reach  their  goal.The  students  were  then  exposed  to  three  kinds  of fears  that  is  the  actual  fear,  psychological  fear,  fantasy  fear.  A  practical  demonstration  on the same was given. Sir believes that the only way to fight the fear is to feel it.</p>
		 <p>&emsp; &emsp;Second  day, session  started  off byMr.  Prashanth  Rao  with  a  recap  highlighting  the previous day topics. The vision statement of Amazon was shown  during the session.
