		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;STELLAPPS  TECHNOLOGIES  PVT  LTD  which  is  basically  an  IoT  based  company.  The company  concentrated  on  the  implementation  of  IoT  in  the  field  of  agriculture  mainly  on Dairy  Farming.  They  explained  as  where  all  their  ideas  have  been  implemented  starting from  the  milking  of  cows  till  the  plants  where  various  dairy  products  are  produced.  They collect  milk  from  farmers  and  check  for  the  fat  and  SNF  values,  based  on  these  values farmers were paid appropriately. The details about the milk like quality and quantity were sent  on  cloud  so  that  total  transparency  could  be  maintained.  We  got  to  know  the  idea  of IoT in those field andthey asked us to improve on it.
