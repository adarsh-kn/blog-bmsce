		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;A workshop on 'HAM –Amateur Radio’ was organized by the department of Telecommunication of BMSCE for the students interested in the wireless communication and electronics.Amateur radio, also known asham radio, describes the use ofradio frequencyspectrumfor purposes ofnon-commercialexchange of messages,wirelessexperimentation, self-training, private recreation,radio  sport,contesting,  and  emergency  communication.  The  term  "amateur"  is  used  to specify "a duly authorised person interested in radioelectric practice with a purely personal aim and withoutpecuniaryinterest" and to differentiate it fromcommercial broadcasting, public safety (such as police and fire), or professionaltwo-way radioservices (such as maritime, aviation, taxis, etc.).

The  various  aspects  included  the  advent  and usage of satellite and wireless communication. The speaker also enlightened the participants about a satellite,   the   importance,   classifications   and   the   laws   obeyed   by   the   orbiting   satellites. Mr. Subramani also spoke about satellites and their types andthe speed required for a satellite to be launched and to orbit around a planet. He also provided a brief comparison of the various orbits. The  second  session  consisted  of  the  introduction  to  Amateur  HAM  radio  and  its  usefulness.  The Speaker  provided  information  on  the  satellite  OSCAR,  which  is  an  orbiting  satellite  carrying Amateur  radio  wherein  free  launches  are  provided.  Here,  the  activities  are  not  only  restricted  to terrestrial  communication.  </p>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; The  speaker  also  spoke  about  the  importance  of  being  a  HAM.For example,  they  always  have  bright  ideas,  they  know  everything  about  communication, and  theycut 
across  boundaries  to  form  groups.  An  OSCAR  is  essentially  designed  to  carry  Amateur  Radio Transponders.  The  second  sub-topic  which  was  talked  about  was,  AMSAT  which  is  the  Radio Amateur Satellite Cooperation.  The day's session ended on a high note as the participants gained knowledge on the various satellites required   for   HAM   and   the   advantages/disadvantages   of   launching   a   satellite   and   the   basic requirements  for  radio  propagation  to  take  place  like;  repeaters,  transponders  and  the  type  of payload requirementsThe objective of enlightening the students about the resourcefulness and usefulness about HAM and Satellites was attained.The earnest and energetic participation by the students lived up to the mission of the wor</p>
