		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;Being a part of the Fine Arts Club of our college is such an amazing experience all year round and the Go Green Ganesha making was not an exception to that. The FAC and 2 other clubs of our college joined hands for the Ganesh Chaturthi festival to celebrate it in a different way and it was a super hit as expected. Now let me share my experience in this event. Over the years Bengaluru has been opening up to the idea of celebrating Ganesha Chaturthi in an eco-friendly manner. This year’s effort seems several notches higher as seen in the recent Guinness record set by 2,138 Bangaloreans who gathered at the National College Grounds to simultaneously create ‘Green Ganesha idols.’

		While the official adjudicator for record, Swapnil Dangarikar, stamped the new feat under the category of ‘most people sculpting with modelling clay’, for participants it was an opportunity to show their passion for the environment at the ‘Go-green Ganesha’ event.

			&emsp; &emsp; The pottery studio will not be using any mould for the clay. Instead, they will use natural lakeside clay that can be dried and reused as soil for potted plants. It is also a matter of getting in touch with your body and hand movements, said Suma GV, an artist who will be conducting a workshop at Dialogues Café, JP Nagar, this Saturday. “Clay is moldable and enables you to get in touch with your creativity, and shape it the way you want to,” she said, adding that the love that comes from making your idol will only add to the festivities.
