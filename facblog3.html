		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;Being the senior coordinator of a 5-star club like FAC is such an honor and I am truly grateful that i got to serve that role for the year 2019-20. It was truly an amazing experience that I am going to cherish for a lifetime. All the events that were planned and organised under my guidance and assisstance got a very good response from the teachers and the students which are very memorable.

			&emsp; &emsp; Especially on a large team, you’ll be surprised how often what one person hates doing, another person will love.
			By getting to know the work that excites each of your team members most, you can make it much more likely people get to work on things they enjoy at least part of the time. You can also then avoid the dreaded situation where you assign work to one person who hates it and another person wishes they could have that task.
			More importantly, you’re tapping into research that shows clearly that the teams that perform the best lean on the strengths of their team. It also helps you understand what makes them tick. Learning things that were influential in their past helps you know what to give them more of, and just as important, understand what to avoid, or that will upset them.
