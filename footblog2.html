		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;It was the night before my first game of football with an actual team, I was so excited but nervous at the same time. I set out my kit for when I woke up. Then I lay in my bed wondering if I'll be able to score failing that play well enough to get chose to play again next week. Loads of clips played out in my head while I was trying to predict what was going to happen throughout the match. Some were good like scoring a goal but some were bad like me getting injured. I tried to block out the bad ones as much as possible because I though that would mean that there was less chance of them actually happening.

			&emsp; &emsp; I eventually fell asleep into a dream that we won because I scored the winning goal, it was one of the best dreams I'd ever had, everyone was applauding and whistling then my team picked me up onto their shoulders. Suddenly I woke up to my mum shouting "Get up... Get up or you'll be late to your first match!" I jumped out of my bed and into the shower, I got washed as fast as possible because I thought we were genuinely going to be late but it turned out she only said that to get me out of bed. On the way out the door
			I grabbed a couple slices of toast and headed into the car. After about twenty five minutes we entered a car park connected to a 11-a-side football pitch. I sprinted over to the partially warm changing rooms to get out of the frosty outdoors. I sat down amongst my teammates to get an inspirational speech from our coach. He talked about everything that we already went over during training a few days ago. I guess it was just to remind us considering everyone was half asleep. Soon after we progressed onto the pitch to start the warm up drill. Witch to our coach basically meant jog up and down the pitch until you ran out of breath. After a few minutes passed the opposing team showed up in their red and white striped kits. They were the same age as us but they were half the height of us except from their goal keeper. The majority of my teammates burst out in laugher, except I was thinking just because their very small doesnâ€™t mean their bad at football.
