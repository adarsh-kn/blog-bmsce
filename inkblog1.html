		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;When I first looked at the title, I thought: 'Built a friend'? You mean you built a 'friendship'? And boy, was I wrong. The title couldn't be more apt. The song is about a little boy, building a friend for himself from a cardboard box and an old phone. I wondered if this was one of those so-called imaginary friends, and kept wondering until the end. Throughout his childhood, the boy plays with his friend, a being with a human body dressed in warm clothes, with a cardboard box for a head and, what looked like orange light bulbs, for eyes. They spend fun times together and think they will be together forever. But, time isn't compassionate towards their friendship. The boy joins college, with no choice but to leave his friend behind at home. A tearful parting ensues. He takes with him pictures of his now old friend.

			&emsp; &emsp; Time passes. The boy, now a young man, meets new love at college and spends more time away from home. Neglecting his old friend does not hurt him, because his priorities have already shifted. He sends his friend a hollow season's greetings message and doesn't visit home often. When he finally comes home, he sees his friend sprawled on the table, dead. A note in pencil, beside the body, tells how he couldn't handle the sheer loneliness without anyone for company. By this point, my eyes were moist and my throat felt crushed. Judging from the slow, emotion-filled voice of the singer throughout the song, I knew this end was coming. And yet, realizing that this was how their friendship ended, was heart-breaking. The growing callousness of the young man was saddening until I realized this is how many friendships get destroyed in reality. The pain-stricken voice of the singer made me feel hopelessly sad for the box-headed being. The low, slow tone, the pauses, the intonation, and the slight ups and downs in the singer's voice made me feel a light-hearted sadness. The simple lyrics resulted in a soft, wistful impression, perfect for a song this emotional.
