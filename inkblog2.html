		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;Roshan turned around to make his way to the Utsav helpdesk, after finally conceding his defeat at trying to locate the "Platinum Block". It was super sunny. As he shoved through the stuffy crowd, he practiced the question several times in his mind, so he wouldn't mess it up. "Excuse me, I need to get to the AR event at the platinum block" he recited, while carefully deciding on his facial expressions. "Excuse me, I need to get to the platinum event at the AR block" he spouted, mortifyingly realizing that he did, in fact, mess up. He wished he had joined the same college as Anisha, not a game design institute. That way, he wouldnâ€™t be so lost. "You mean the AR event in the platinum block? Go straight and take a left, your event is on the 7th floor of the white building there." The guy said, his hand pointing towards the right. Without uttering another word, Roshan forced himself to follow the instructions, rushing to the location, his face flushing with sheer embarrassment. Anisha had even drawn a map to prevent him from getting lost, which was exactly what had happened, and he had to humiliate himself in front of the helpdesk guy. What a great day. He really had to improve his real-world socialisation skills, he told himself. Turning left, he was relieved to see a huge banner, confirming that he was going right. He mentally patted his back. After all, he had done a good job, considering all the difficulties he'd encountered with the directions. "AR GAME EVENT, SPONSORED BY BIBTENDO AND WIZARDS OF THE SHORE, on the 7th floor, at 2 PM" He read it out loud, proudly beaming at the banner outside the building. "2:05 PM", he saw the time, glancing at his phone as if he'd gotten a notification. His brain stopped working for a millisecond as all his glory turned into utter dread. The event had already started and Anisha was going to kill him for this. He strode up the stairs outside the building and saw the elevator open. Without thinking, he broke into a sprint towards it. Barely making it into the crowded lift, through his ragged breathing, he grinned, happy that he would reach just a little faster.

			&emsp; &emsp; As it transpires every time you need to frantically rush, the lift was going downwards when he needed to go upwards. The realization didn't dawn on him until after the lift opened again at basement level two. He heaved a sigh of defeat, yet again. Standing uncomfortably squashed between two middle-aged professors who were chatting away in Kannada, he spent the next agonizing ten minutes tapping his foot in impatience and worrying if he would even be alive after he faced Anisha. The elevator stopped painfully at every floor, even when there was no one getting on. By the time it reached the 7th floor, Roshan had prepared for his imminent death at the hands of his childhood best friend. He was looking around for any signs of the event when he felt a hand yank him urgently across the hallway. He moved his head to smile at her and immediately had to look away as he felt her vicious eyes bore into him, seething with anger. If looks could kill. Anisha was smart but short-tempered, capable of making the best strategy but raging at the slightest of things. "Jeez, I'm sorry for being late. You don't have to be mean, you know." "I didn't expect anything better from a piece of rock like you, dumbass." They reached the organizer's desk whilst snapping insults at each other, and submitted their registration slips there. "We're so sorry for being late. Our characters are a fighter half-orc named Vorrgh and a human wizard called Aela. Preferred weapons are a machete and a staff wand." Anisha informed them.
