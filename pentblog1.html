		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;Being a member of the first ever mathematical society in the city is such an honor. The events that this Pentagram club conducts are absolutely different and amazing. The 'Math Mania' was not an exception to it. This event was one of my first events that i took part after i became a part of the Pentagram family and it was total fun participating in it. The event started with a qualifying round with a total of 10-12 teams. Each team had 2 members and thankfully I and my teammate qualified for the next round.

			&emsp; &emsp; Here was where the real fun began! The game which was designed was one of its kind. I had interest in logical math from my childhood but I had never heard of such an innovative game. Wanna hear about it? When we need to get somewhere we might be working out how far it is and then estimating the time it will take to get there, and using our time-telling skills to figure out what time to leave the house to get there on time. We might even work in a diversion to the petrol station for an extra challenge. And finally my I and my teammate secured the third place! Hurray!!
