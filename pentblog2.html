		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;Maths is always around us in ways we cannot see. You can guarantee that any technology we use is utilising maths to work out both calculations (cash machines, self-service tills) and also as part of the programming and algorithms it uses to work – and also to target you for relevant advertising, in the case of social media. We also use maths to save our lives if we need a certain dose of medication or to work out how often to take our tablets. And our brains even do some really fast calculations to work out when it is safe to cross the road.

			&emsp; &emsp; Even without using mathematics in our jobs we are surrounded by it, and you can see from just a few of the examples above that a low numeracy level may affect multiple aspects of your life. People who have not had the chance to practice their numeracy skills early on in life find many of these things tricky and this can result in, at best, missing out on a few bargains, and, at worst, missing out on jobs and other opportunities which impact on their whole lives. Not least our ability to find bargains, spend wisely, be on time, and to work out multiple life decisions each day. On top of that there are, of course, careers where maths is incredibly useful and often necessary. There are jobs which use maths in more traditional and obvious ways – architecture, science, computer programming, accountancy and so on. But also there are careers which rely on maths which may not be so obvious – sportsmen and women who calculate distance and speed, as well as angles and trajectory; and carpenters and builders for whom a miscalculation could cost them a job or their business. The OECD (the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) has found a direct relationship between wage distribution and numeracy skills, which is a good motive for making maths a part of everyday life from a young age!
