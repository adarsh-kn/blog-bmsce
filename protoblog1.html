		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;ProtoFlag is a jeopardy style Capture the Flag game/event where the player solves a series of challenges-which are basically puzzles from the realm of Cyber Security to get what are known as ‘flags’ which can be snippets of code or a name of a piece of hardware or even a file (plain text). The player who gets the most flags wins the game. The questions were of varying difficulty level and covered everything from the classic ciphers to jokes on HTTP methods, from looking closely into an image (pun intended) to figuring out what a zip bomb is, from reverse engineering to decoding the ‘Morse’ in audio files and much more.

			&emsp; &emsp; The event went live on HackerRank for 3 hours every day from the 3rd of April to the 5th of April. Every day was harder to come by. You had to use your googling skills to the maximum and obviously had to have some grey cells between your ears! Some days the players had to request for extra time. The clues for every question was put up on our official Instagram page. The event was meant for the for the 1st and 2nd year students of every department and the winner got the bragging rights.
