		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;Mr. Vishwanadh Raju started off a workshop, organised by the CSE department club of BMSCE, Protocol, on ‘Future skillsʼ making the audience realise the importance of nontechnical skills in the IT industry. He defined “future skills” as the ‘ability to act successful on a complex problem in a future unknown context of action’. It refers to an individuals’ disposition to act in a self-organised way, visible to the outside as performance.
		</p>
		<p>
			&emsp; &emsp; From the importance of acquiring these skills being stressed upon to implementing them in the different types of emerging fields in the IT industry, Mr. Raju opened a new door of thought in the minds of the young student audience. The workshop was a success in making the students yearn for answers to questions they had never previously thought of and these questions were graciously entertained by the resource person, whether it be about the technological advancements in recent years or the future as well.
