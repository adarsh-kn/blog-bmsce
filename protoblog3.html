		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;Treasure Hunt was an individual Capture the Flag type event wherein each participant had to find clues from codes, web pages etc. These clues were required to be submitted on Hacker rank and were scored according to the time taken to acquire them. The participant could only proceed to the next question after solving and obtaining the clue for the previous question. The winner of Online Treasure Hunt was awarded with a cash prize of worth Rs.750 and runner up with Rs.250.

			&emsp; &emsp; The event went live on HackerRank for 3 hours every day from the 3rd of April to the 5th of April. Every day was harder to come by. You had to use your googling skills to the maximum and obviously had to have some grey cells between your ears! Some days the players had to request for extra time. The clues for every question was put up on our official Instagram page. The event was meant for the for the 1st and 2nd year students of every department and the winner got the bragging rights. E-certificates were provided to all the participants.
