		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;I have had this passion for competing in quizzes from a very young age. I won many prizes then. But being a quiz master was never in my sphere. I was offered this oppurtunity and I welcomed it. Being a quiz master of the club in as good a college as BMSCE is itself a great achievement according to me. So let me tell you about my experience as briefly as possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			&emsp; &emsp; Far too many quizzes I attended in the city made me feel like a new recruit in an army platoon. Or, even an animal in the circus. Jumping through hoops and wading through mud to entertain the audience. And the quizmasters, who had little regard for the questions they were asking, or the quizzers they were putting those questions to, often came away the only winners, being paid a bomb for their measly efforts. A few years back, while reviewing a book of fiction written by a professor from my college, I had written that it took me a long time to realise that teachers are human beings too. The realisation that quizmasters are human beings dawned on me rather quickly in comparison. The contempt that the younger, more upstart me had fondly nurtured for other quizmasters gradually began turning into grudging respect, or at least some degree of understanding. I learned a fact easily forgotten: that the two most vital aspects of a good quiz are the matter and the manner, one not any more or less important than the other. I came to greatly admire, and occasionally envy, those who I think score above me in either department. Matter is, of course, the content, the ability to make original, well researched, interesting questions. Making them not just in a vacuum, but understanding oneâ€™s participants well, and tailoring the questions accordingly.
