		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;BMS Youth Parliament 4.0. Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has." ~ Margaret Mead.<br>

		&emsp; &emsp; With the very motive, over 60 young enthusiasts participated in the fourth edition of Youth Parliament organized by the Rotaract club of BMSCE on 13th and 14th of November 2019. The main goal of this event was to involve the young minds of the nation in the proceedings of democracy and law making.

			&emsp; &emsp; With the Agenda of BMSYP 4.0 being "Sustainable India and it's Economic Implications", Day 1 started with welcoming the excited gathering and briefing about this agenda and rules of the proceedings.
			The first day was divided into 3 sessions.
			The 1st session started with the opening statements by the Prime Minister, Leader of Opposition, representatives of each state followed by the Cabinet. Refreshments were served to give everyone a break after a busy session 1.
			The discussion continued in the next session. Lunch was provided to everyone after which the last session was concluded by the debates and discussions focussing the main agenda.

			Day 2 of BMSYP 4.0 began with a briefing on the bill passing procedures.
			A bill was prepared after a long discussion and was presented to the parliament. Later voting took place on each and every clause at the end of which the bill was passed by the Parliament. The next session was followed by the Press Conference where the representatives were questioned.
			In the end the deserving ministers were appreciated for their successful participation. Our faculty co-ordinator, Prof, Arjun presented the trophies to the winner, runner up and the special mentions.

			Helping youth in building leadership skills is a critical element of preparing them for their entry into adulthood and for the nation's progress as well. With BMSYP, we believe to have recognized, utilized youth strength and have taken a small step towards an enormous change in the future.
