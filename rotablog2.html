		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;iTeach : Small steps towards a more educated society.<br>

			&emsp; &emsp; Phase 2 of the iteach program by the Rotaract club of BMSCE took place in the month of February 2015. This was conducted in 3 schools namely Mahila Mandali, Basavangudi High school and Rajarajeshwari Government School with a team of volunteers teaching in one particular school for a span for 3 weeks. The subjects taken up were Fun with Math, Science and social science. The topics under each of them were several with math comprising of graphs, area and perimeter, probability and Vedic math; science – space and constellations, light and its properties, osmosis etc; social science - voting and its importance, maps and globes, influential personalities of today.

			&emsp; &emsp; Methods adopted in teaching included real-life examples, videos, demonstration of experiments, quizzes, and activities for the kids: all done to ensure learning grows beyond the four walls of a classroom. Also, we collaborated with the Fine Arts Club of BMSCE and the Yoga team of BMSCE making it a comprehensive program. 
			“The iTeach initiative was the first activity of the Rotaract Club that caught my attention in the beginning of the first semester. I couldn’t wait to be a part of what promised to be a unique teaching experience. I think it is wonderful for us to be working towards encouraging young minds coming from less privileged background through this fun filled take at learning” shares Rotaractor @Balaji.
			All in all, Rotaract Club of BMSCE eagerly waits for the next phase for iteach.
