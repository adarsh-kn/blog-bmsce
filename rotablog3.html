		<p>	&emsp; &emsp;The Rotaract Club of BMSCE celebrated diwali along with the children of Swavalambhi Trust.
			Around 10 volunteers conducted fun activities to build communication skills and team spirit. We had group skipping, and a fun game called "MAFIA". To conclude the session we helped the children light diyas which were painted in the previous Mentorship session.

		<p>
			&emsp; &emsp; The final session of the Mentorship Programme concluded with a message to spread eco-friendly Diwali 
			and saw a significant improvement in soft skills of the children. A huge shout-out to all our volunteers who actively helped us conduct events and keep the kids at the orphanage engaged these past few weeks. We are very glad to have wrapped up this phase of mentorship with some really fun and educative session and we hope that the children have gained a lot of knowledge and experiences from this program.
